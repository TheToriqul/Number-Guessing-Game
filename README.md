## Number Guessing Game**

This Python code implements a classic number guessing game where you try to guess a secret number hidden within a user-specified range. The code provides helpful feedback to guide you towards the correct answer, making it an engaging and fun experience.

**Key Features:**

- **Dynamic Range:** You dictate the upper limit of the guessing range, ensuring flexibility and personalization.
- **Valid Input Handling:** The code gracefully handles invalid inputs, such as non-numeric input or numbers outside the designated range, guiding you towards valid input formats.
- **Clear Instructions:** Prompts and messages are well-structured and easy to understand, enhancing the usability of the game.
- **Informative Feedback:** After each guess, the code indicates whether your guess was too high, too low, or spot-on, offering valuable clues to hone your strategy.
- **Success Notification:** Upon guessing the correct number, the code congratulates you and displays the number of guesses it took, providing a sense of accomplishment.

**How to Play:**

1. **Launch the program:** Run the Python script.
2. **Set the maximum range:** Enter a positive integer as the highest number you're willing to guess.
3. **Make your guesses:** After receiving feedback on each guess, keep refining your attempts until you find the secret number.

**Example:**

Imagine the maximum range is set to 100. The secret number is 42. Here's a possible gameplay scenario:

```
Make a guess: 75
You were above the number!
Make a guess: 15
You were below the number!
Make a guess: 38
You were below the number!
Make a guess: 42
You got the correct number :)
You got it in 4 guesses. Congratulation!
```

I hope you enjoy this number guessing game!




## Explaining the Number Guessing Game Codes:

This Python code creates a number guessing game where you try to find a secret number hidden within a range you decide. Let's break it down step-by-step:

**1. Imports and Welcome Message:**

```python
import random

print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
```

- `import random`: This line brings in the `random` module, which allows us to generate random numbers.
- `print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")`: This simply prints a welcome message to the user.

**2. Setting the Maximum Range:**

```python
max_range = input("Type a maximum number of your guess: ")

if max_range.isdigit():
  max_range = int(max_range)
  if max_range <= 0:
    print("Please type a number less than 0 next time")
    quit()
else:
  print("Please type a nice number next time")
  quit()
```

- `max_range = input(...)`: This line asks the user to enter the highest number they want to guess (the maximum range).
- `if max_range.isdigit()`: This condition checks if the user entered a valid number (digits only).
- `max_range = int(max_range)`: If it's valid, converts the input string to an integer.
- `if max_range <= 0`: If the number is 0 or negative, it's invalid, so the program exits with an error message.
- `else`: If the input isn't a number, it's also invalid, and the program exits with an error message.

**3. Generating the Secret Number:**

```python
random_number = random.randint(0, max_range)
```

- `random_number = random.randint(0, max_range)`: This line uses the `random` module to generate a random integer between 0 and the maximum range you entered. This is the secret number you're trying to guess.

**4. Guessing Loop:**

```python
guess_score = 0
while True:
  guess_score += 1
  user_guess = input("Make a guess: ")
  if user_guess.isdigit():
    user_guess = int(user_guess)
  else:
    print("Please type a number next time!")
    continue
  if user_guess == random_number:
    print("You got the correct number :)")
    break
  elif user_guess > random_number:
    print("You were above the number!")
  else:
    print("You were below the number!")
```

- `guess_score = 0`: This initializes a variable to keep track of your guesses.
- `while True`: This creates a loop that keeps running until you guess the correct number.
- `guess_score += 1`: Inside the loop, it increments the guess counter after each attempt.
- `user_guess = input(...)`: Similar to before, it asks you to enter your guess.
- `if user_guess.isdigit()`: Checks if your guess is a valid number.
- `if user_guess == random_number`: If your guess matches the secret number, the loop breaks, and you win!
- `elif user_guess > random_number`: If your guess is too high, it gives you a hint.
- `else`: If your guess is too low, it gives you another hint.

**5. Congratulations and Summary:**

```python
print("You got it in", guess_score, "guesses. Congratulation!")
```

- This line prints a congratulatory message mentioning how many guesses it took you to win.
